Demos

Here are some demos of how to use the ALTER TABLE statement:

SQL
-- Add a new column to the `users` table.
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN age INT;

-- Delete the `age` column from the `users` table.
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN age;

-- Rename the `username` column to `name`.
ALTER TABLE users RENAME COLUMN username TO name;

-- Change the data type of the `age` column to `DATE`.
ALTER TABLE users CHANGE COLUMN age age DATE;

-- Set a default value of `18` for the `age` column.
ALTER TABLE users SET DEFAULT 18 FOR age;

-- Add a constraint to the `users` table that ensures that the `age` column is never less than 18.
ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT age_check CHECK (age >= 18);

-- Delete the constraint from the `users` table.
ALTER TABLE users DROP CONSTRAINT age_check;
