Concepts

A constraint is a rule that restricts the data that can be stored in a table.
A primary key is a column that uniquely identifies each row in a table.
A foreign key is a column that references the primary key of another table.
A unique constraint ensures that each row in a table has a unique value for a particular column.
A check constraint ensures that the values in a column meet certain criteria.
Demos

Here are some demos of how to use constraints:

SQL
-- Create a table called `users` with a `username` column as the primary key.
CREATE TABLE users (
  username VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY
);

-- Create a table called `posts` with a `user_id` column that references the `id` column of the `users` table.
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id)
);

-- Create a unique constraint on the `username` column of the `users` table.
ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT username_unique UNIQUE (username);

-- Create a check constraint on the `age` column of the `users` table that ensures that the value is greater than or equal to 18.
ALTER TABLE users ADD CONSTRAINT age_check CHECK (age >= 18);
