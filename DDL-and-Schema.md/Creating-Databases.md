Demos

Here are some demos of how to create databases and tables:

SQL
-- Create a database called `my_database`.
CREATE DATABASE my_database;

-- Create a table called `users` with three columns: `id`, `name`, and `email`.
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

-- Insert a row into the `users` table.
INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES ('John Doe', 'johndoe@example.com');

-- Select all rows from the `users` table.
SELECT * FROM users;
