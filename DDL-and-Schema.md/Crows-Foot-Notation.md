Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
Database Schema
Concepts

Crow's Foot Notation is a type of entity relationship diagram (ERD) that uses a specific set of symbols to represent the relationships between entities in a database.
An ERD is a graphical representation of the structure of a database. It shows the entities (tables) in the database, as well as the relationships between them.
A database schema is a blueprint of a database. It defines the structure of the database, including the tables, columns, and relationships between them.
Demos

Here is a demo of how to use Crow's Foot Notation to create an ERD:

Start by drawing a box for each entity in your database.
Connect the boxes with lines to represent the relationships between the entities.
Use a specific symbol to represent each type of relationship.
For example, you could use a solid line to represent a one-to-many relationship, and a dashed line to represent a many-to-many relationship.

Here is a demo of how to create a database schema:

Start by creating a table for each entity in your database.
Define the columns in each table.
Define the relationships between the tables.
For example, you could define a relationship between the Users table and the Posts table by specifying that each User can have many Posts, and each Post can have one User.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
