Default value
SERIAL
Concepts

A default value is a value that is automatically assigned to a column if no other value is specified.
SERIAL is a special type of data type that automatically increments for each new row that is added to a table.
Demos

Here is a demo of how to set a default value for a column:

SQL
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  age INT DEFAULT 18
);
Use code with caution. Learn more
In this example, the age column has a default value of 18. If no value is specified for the age column when a new row is added to the table, the value 18 will be used instead.

Here is a demo of how to use SERIAL:

SQL
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
Use code with caution. Learn more
In this example, the id column is a SERIAL type. This means that the value of the id column will automatically increment for each new row that is added to the table.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
