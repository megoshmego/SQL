Concepts

Deletion behavior is the way that a database deletes rows from a table. There are two main types of deletion behavior:
ON DELETE CASCADE: When a row is deleted from a table, all rows in other tables that reference the deleted row are also deleted.
ON DELETE SET NULL: When a row is deleted from a table, all rows in other tables that reference the deleted row have their reference set to NULL.
A foreign key is a column in a table that references a primary key in another table. Foreign keys are used to enforce referential integrity, which ensures that the data in a database is consistent.
SERIAL is a special type of data type that automatically increments for each new row that is added to a table.
Demos

Here is a demo of how to set up ON DELETE CASCADE:

SQL
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Alice'), ('Bob');

INSERT INTO posts (user_id, title) VALUES (1, 'My first post'), (2, 'My second post');

DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;

SELECT * FROM posts;
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will delete the user with the ID of 1 and all of their posts.

Here is a demo of how to set up ON DELETE SET NULL:

SQL
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INT REFERENCES users (id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('Alice'), ('Bob');

INSERT INTO posts (user_id, title) VALUES (1, 'My first post'), (2, 'My second post');

DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;

SELECT * FROM posts;
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will delete the user with the ID of 1, but their posts will remain in the database with their user_id set to NULL.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions!
