Concepts

An index is a special data structure that helps a database find rows quickly.
A B-tree is a type of index that is commonly used in databases.
Logarithmic time is a measure of how quickly an algorithm can find a row in an index.
Linear time is a measure of how quickly an algorithm can find a row in a table without an index.
Demos

Here is a demo of how to create an index in PostgreSQL:

SQL
CREATE INDEX subreddit_name_index ON subreddits (name);
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will create an index on the name column of the subreddits table.

Here is a demo of how to use an index to speed up a query:

SQL
SELECT * FROM subreddits WHERE name = 'soccer';
Use code with caution. Learn more
Without an index, this query would have to scan the entire subreddits table, which could take a long time if there are a lot of rows in the table. With an index, the database can quickly find the row that matches the name value, which makes the query much faster.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
