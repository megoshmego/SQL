ON DELETE CASCADE
Concepts

A many to many relationship is a relationship between two tables where each row in one table can be related to many rows in the other table, and vice versa.
A join table is a table that is used to represent a many to many relationship between two other tables.
A foreign key is a column in a table that references a primary key in another table.
ON DELETE CASCADE is a constraint that specifies that if a row is deleted from a table, all rows in other tables that reference the deleted row will also be deleted.
Demos

Here is a demo of how to create a many to many relationship in PostgreSQL:

SQL
CREATE TABLE movies (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  release_year INT NOT NULL,
  runtime INT NOT NULL,
  rating VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE actors (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  first_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  last_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  birth_date DATE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE roles (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  movie_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES movies (id),
  actor_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES actors (id),
  role VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will create three tables: movies, actors, and roles. The movies and actors tables will have a one to many relationship with the roles table. Each row in the roles table will reference a row in the movies table and a row in the actors table.

Here is a demo of how to use a join table to query a many to many relationship:

SQL
SELECT m.title, a.first_name, a.last_name, r.role
FROM movies m
JOIN roles r ON m.id = r.movie_id
JOIN actors a ON r.actor_id = a.id
WHERE m.title = 'The Shawshank Redemption';
Use code with caution. Learn more
This query will return all of the roles in the movie The Shawshank Redemption.
