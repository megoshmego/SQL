Concepts

Null is a special value in SQL that represents no value, the lack of a value, or an unknown value.
The IS NULL operator is used to test if a value is null.
A default value is a value that is automatically assigned to a column if no other value is specified.
A constraint is a rule that restricts the values that can be stored in a column or table.
A unique constraint ensures that each row in a table has a unique value for a particular column.
Demos

Here is a demo of how to use the IS NULL operator to test if a value is null:

SQL
SELECT * FROM subreddits WHERE name IS NULL;
Use code with caution. Learn more
This query will return all of the rows in the subreddits table where the name column is null.

Here is a demo of how to create a default value for a column:

SQL
ALTER TABLE subreddits ALTER COLUMN name SET DEFAULT 'default_value';
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will change the name column so that it automatically gets the value default_value if no other value is specified.

Here is a demo of how to create a unique constraint:

SQL
ALTER TABLE subreddits ADD CONSTRAINT unique_subreddit_name UNIQUE (name);
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will create a unique constraint on the name column, which ensures that each row in the subreddits table has a unique value for the name column.
