Concepts

Normalization is a technique for organizing data in a database in a way that minimizes redundancy and dependency.
The first normal form (1NF) is a database design in which each table contains only one data type.
The second normal form (2NF) is a database design in which each table contains only one primary key and each non-primary key column is dependent on the primary key.
The third normal form (3NF) is a database design in which each non-primary key column is dependent on the primary key and is not transitively dependent on the primary key.
Denormalization is a technique for organizing data in a database in a way that increases redundancy in order to improve performance.
Demos

Here is a demo of how to normalize a database:

Create a table called products with the following columns:
id (integer, primary key)
name (varchar(255))
price (decimal(10,2))
quantity (integer)
Create a table called categories with the following columns:
id (integer, primary key)
name (varchar(255))
Create a table called products_categories with the following columns:
product_id (integer, foreign key to products.id)
category_id (integer, foreign key to categories.id)
This database is now in 1NF because each table contains only one data type. However, it is not in 2NF because the quantity column in the products table is not dependent on the primary key. To fix this, we can create a new table called inventory with the following columns:

Code snippet
* `product_id` (integer, foreign key to `products.id`)
* `quantity` (integer)
Use code with caution. Learn more
This database is now in 2NF because each table contains only one primary key and each non-primary key column is dependent on the primary key. However, it is not in 3NF because the quantity column in the inventory table is transitively dependent on the primary key. To fix this, we can create a new table called locations with the following columns:

Code snippet
* `id` (integer, primary key)
* `name` (varchar(255))
* `product_id` (integer, foreign key to `products.id`)
* `quantity` (integer)
Use code with caution. Learn more
This database is now in 3NF because each non-primary key column is dependent on the primary key and is not transitively dependent on the primary key.

Here is a demo of how to denormalize a database:

Create a table called products with the following columns:
id (integer, primary key)
name (varchar(255))
price (decimal(10,2))
quantity (integer)
category (varchar(255))
This database is in 3NF. However, it is not very efficient because it requires multiple queries to get all of the information about a product. To improve performance, we can denormalize the database by creating a new table called product_categories with the following columns:

Code snippet
* `product_id` (integer, foreign key to `products.id`)
* `category` (varchar(255))
Use code with caution. Learn more
This database is now in 1NF, but it is less normalized than the previous database. This means that it is more likely to contain errors, but it is also more efficient.
