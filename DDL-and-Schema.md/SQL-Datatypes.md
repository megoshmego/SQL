Serial
Concepts:
A datatype is a way of specifying the type of data that can be stored in a column.
The most common datatypes are integer, float, text, boolean, date, time, and timestamp.
The serial datatype is a special datatype that automatically increments the value of a column each time a new row is inserted.
Demos:
Here is a demo of how to create a table with different datatypes:

SQL
CREATE TABLE my_table (
  id INT,
  name TEXT,
  age INT,
  is_active BOOLEAN,
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
Use code with caution. Learn more
This table has five columns:

id: An integer column that is the primary key of the table.
name: A text column that stores the name of the person.
age: An integer column that stores the age of the person.
is_active: A boolean column that stores whether the person is active.
created_at: A timestamp column that stores the date and time the person was created.
Here is a demo of how to insert data into a table with different datatypes:

SQL
INSERT INTO my_table (name, age, is_active, created_at) VALUES ('John Doe', 30, TRUE, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
Use code with caution. Learn more
This inserts a new row into the my_table table with the following values:

name: John Doe
age: 30
is_active: TRUE
created_at: The current date and time
I hope this helps!
