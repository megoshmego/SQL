Concepts:
Aggregate functions are functions that compute a single value from a set of inputs.
The most common aggregate function is COUNT, which returns the number of rows in a set.
Other common aggregate functions include AVG (average), MAX (maximum), and MIN (minimum).
Aggregate functions can be used to summarize data, such as finding the average price of all books in a table or the maximum page count of all books by a particular author.
Demos:
Here is a demo of how to use the COUNT function to find the number of rows in a table:
Code snippet
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM books;
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will return the number 40, which is the number of rows in the books table.

Code snippet
* Here is a demo of how to use the AVG function to find the average price of all books in a table:

Code snippet
SELECT AVG(price)
FROM books;
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will return the number 2.99, which is the average price of all books in the books table.

Code snippet
* Here is a demo of how to use the MAX function to find the maximum page count of all books by a particular author:
Use code with caution. Learn more
Code snippet
SELECT MAX(page_count)
FROM books
WHERE author = 'J.K. Rowling';
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will return the number 736, which is the maximum page count of all books by J.K. Rowling.

I hope this helps!
