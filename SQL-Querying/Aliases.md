Sure, here is my evaluation of the script:

Title: Aliases
Section: SQL
Subsection: SQL-Querying
Key Terms:
Alias
GROUP BY
ORDER BY
Concepts:
An alias is a name that you can give to a column or expression in a SQL query.
Aliases can be used to make your queries more readable and easier to understand.
You can use aliases in the SELECT, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY clauses of a SQL query.
Demos:
Here is a demo of how to use an alias to rename a column:
Code snippet
SELECT author AS "Author Name", title AS "Book Title"
FROM books;
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will return the same results as the following query, but the column names will be more readable:

Code snippet
SELECT author, title
FROM books;
Use code with caution. Learn more
Code snippet
* Here is a demo of how to use an alias in the GROUP BY clause:
Use code with caution. Learn more
Code snippet
SELECT author, COUNT(*) AS "Number of Books"
FROM books
GROUP BY author;
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will return a table with one row for each author, and the number of books that each author has written.

Code snippet
* Here is a demo of how to use an alias in the ORDER BY clause:
Use code with caution. Learn more
Code snippet
SELECT author, title
FROM books
ORDER BY author DESC;
Use code with caution. Learn more
This will return the books in alphabetical order by author, with the most recent author first.

I hope this helps!
