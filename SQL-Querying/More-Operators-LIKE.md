Concepts

The LIKE operator is used to match patterns in text.
The percent sign (%) can be used to match any number of characters.
The underscore (_) can be used to match a single character.
The ILIKE operator is a case-insensitive version of the LIKE operator.
Demos

Here are some demos of how to use the LIKE and ILIKE operators:

SQL
-- Match any book title that starts with the letter "T"
SELECT title
FROM books
WHERE title LIKE 'T%';

-- Match any book title that contains the word "the"
SELECT title
FROM books
WHERE title LIKE '%the%';

-- Match any book title that ends with the letter "G"
SELECT title
FROM books
WHERE title ILIKE '%G';
