Concepts

SQL is a database language that is used to create, read, update, and delete data.
CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic operations that can be performed on data in a database.
The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database.
The INSERT statement is used to insert new data into a database.
The UPDATE statement is used to update existing data in a database.
The DELETE statement is used to delete data from a database.
The FROM clause is used to specify the table or tables that the SELECT statement should retrieve data from.
The WHERE clause is used to specify a condition that the rows must meet in order to be retrieved.
The GROUP BY clause is used to group the rows together based on a common value.
The HAVING clause is used to specify a condition that the groups must meet in order to be included in the results.
The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the rows in a particular order.
The LIMIT clause is used to limit the number of rows that are returned.
The OFFSET clause is used to skip a certain number of rows before returning the results.
The semicolon (;) is used to terminate a SQL statement.
Demos

Here are some demos of how to use the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements:

SQL
-- Select all columns from the books table.
SELECT * FROM books;

-- Select the title and author columns from the books table.
SELECT title, author FROM books;

-- Select the title column from the books table where the price is greater than 100.
SELECT title FROM books WHERE price > 100;

-- Select the title column from the books table where the author is "J.K. Rowling".
SELECT title FROM books WHERE author = 'J.K. Rowling';

-- Insert a new row into the books table.
INSERT INTO books (title, author, price) VALUES ('The Design of Everyday Things', 'Don Norman', 12.99);

-- Update the price of the book with the title "The Design of Everyday Things" to 14.99.
UPDATE books SET price = 14.99 WHERE title = 'The Design of Everyday Things';

-- Delete the row from the books table where the title is "The Design of Everyday Things".
DELETE FROM books WHERE title = 'The Design of Everyday Things';
