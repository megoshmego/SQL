SELECT * FROM books WHERE price > 30;

-- Select all rows where the author is Kyle Simpson.
SELECT * FROM books WHERE author = 'Kyle Simpson';

-- Select all rows where the book title starts with the letter "A".
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE 'A%';

-- Select all rows where the page count is between 500 and 600 pages.
SELECT * FROM books WHERE page_count BETWEEN 500 AND 600;
