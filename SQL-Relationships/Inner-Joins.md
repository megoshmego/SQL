Title: Inner Joins

Key Terms:
Join
Inner Join
Foreign Key
Primary Key
Concepts:
A join is a SQL operation that combines data from two or more tables.
An inner join returns all rows from the two tables where there is a match between the columns specified in the join condition.
A foreign key is a column in one table that refers to the primary key of another table.
A primary key is a column in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table.
Demos:
Here is a demo of how to create a join query:

SQL
SELECT title, name
FROM movies
INNER JOIN studios
ON movies.studio_id = studios.id;
Use code with caution. Learn more
This query will return all rows from the movies table and the studios table where the studio_id column in the movies table matches the id column in the studios table.

Here is a demo of how to use a foreign key:

SQL
CREATE TABLE movies (
  id INT,
  title TEXT,
  release_year INT,
  runtime INT,
  rating VARCHAR(10),
  studio_id INT
);

CREATE TABLE studios (
  id INT,
  name TEXT,
  founded_in INT
);

ALTER TABLE movies
ADD FOREIGN KEY (studio_id)
REFERENCES studios (id);
Use code with caution. Learn more
This code will create two tables, movies and studios. The movies table will have a foreign key column called studio_id that references the id column in the studios table. This means that each row in the movies table must have a corresponding row in the studios table.

I hope this helps!
