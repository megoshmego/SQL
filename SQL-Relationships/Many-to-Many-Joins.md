Title: Many to Many Joins

Section: SQL

Subsection: SQL-Relationships

Key terms, concepts, and any other relevant information and definitions:

Many to many relationship: A many to many relationship is a relationship between two tables where each row in one table can be related to many rows in the other table, and vice versa.
Join: A join is a SQL operation that combines data from two or more tables.
Foreign key: A foreign key is a column in one table that refers to the primary key of another table.
Primary key: A primary key is a column in a table that uniquely identifies each row in the table.
Demos:

Demo 1: This demo shows how to create a many to many relationship between two tables.
Demo 2: This demo shows how to use a join to combine data from two tables.
Demo 3: This demo shows how to use a foreign key to enforce referential integrity.
I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Sure, here are some scripts for demos that might be helpful:

Demo 1: This demo shows how to create a many to many relationship between two tables.

SQL
CREATE TABLE movies (
  id INT,
  title TEXT,
  release_year INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE actors (
  id INT,
  name TEXT,
  birth_date DATE,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE roles (
  movie_id INT,
  actor_id INT,
  PRIMARY KEY (movie_id, actor_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (movie_id) REFERENCES movies (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (actor_id) REFERENCES actors (id)
);

Demo 2: This demo shows how to use a join to combine data from two tables.

SQL
SELECT m.title, a.name
FROM movies m
JOIN roles r ON m.id = r.movie_id
JOIN actors a ON r.actor_id = a.id;
Use code with caution. Learn more
Demo 3: This demo shows how to use a foreign key to enforce referential integrity.

SQL
INSERT INTO movies (title, release_year) VALUES ('The Shawshank Redemption', 1994);

INSERT INTO actors (name, birth_date) VALUES ('Tim Robbins', '1958-04-16');

INSERT INTO roles (movie_id, actor_id) VALUES (1, 1);

-- This will fail because there is no movie with an ID of 2
INSERT INTO roles (movie_id, actor_id) VALUES (2, 1);
Use code with caution. Learn more
I hope these demos are helpful!
