Title: Many to Many Outer Joins

Section: SQL

Subsection: SQL-Relationships

Key terms, concepts, and any other relevant information and definitions:

Outer join: An outer join is a type of join that returns all rows from the left table, even if they do not have a match in the right table, and all rows from the right table, even if they do not have a match in the left table.
Left join: A left join is a type of outer join that returns all rows from the left table, even if they do not have a match in the right table.
Right join: A right join is a type of outer join that returns all rows from the right table, even if they do not have a match in the left table.
Full join: A full join is a type of outer join that returns all rows from both the left and right tables, even if they do not have a match in the other table.
Demos:

Demo 1: This demo shows how to use a left join to return all rows from the left table, even if they do not have a match in the right table.
Demo 2: This demo shows how to use a right join to return all rows from the right table, even if they do not have a match in the left table.
Demo 3: This demo shows how to use a full join to return all rows from both the left and right tables, even if they do not have a match in the other table.

Sure, here are some scripts for demos that might be helpful:

Demo 1: Left Join

SQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  movies m
LEFT JOIN
  roles r ON m.id = r.movie_id;
Use code with caution. Learn more
This query will return all rows from the movies table, even if they do not have a match in the roles table. For example, if there is a movie in the movies table that does not have any roles, it will still be returned in the result set.

Demo 2: Right Join

SQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  roles r
RIGHT JOIN
  movies m ON m.id = r.movie_id;
Use code with caution. Learn more
This query will return all rows from the roles table, even if they do not have a match in the movies table. For example, if there is a role in the roles table that does not have any movies, it will still be returned in the result set.

Demo 3: Full Join

SQL
SELECT
  *
FROM
  movies m
FULL JOIN
  roles r ON m.id = r.movie_id;
Use code with caution. Learn more
This query will return all rows from both the movies and roles tables, even if they do not have a match in the other table. For example, if there is a movie in the movies table that does not have any roles, it will still be returned in the result set, along with a NULL value for the role_id column. Similarly, if there is a role in the roles table that does not have any movies, it will still be returned in the result set, along with a NULL value for the movie_id column.

I hope these demos are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
