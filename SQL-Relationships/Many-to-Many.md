Title: Many to Many Relationships

Section: SQL

Subsection: SQL-Relationships

Key terms, concepts, and any other relevant information and definitions:

Many-to-many relationship: A many-to-many relationship is a type of relationship between two entities where each entity can be related to many instances of the other entity. For example, a student can take many classes, and a class can have many students.
Join table: A join table is a table that is used to represent a many-to-many relationship between two entities. The join table contains columns for the primary keys of the two entities, as well as any other relevant information about the relationship.
Foreign key: A foreign key is a column in a table that references the primary key of another table. Foreign keys are used to enforce referential integrity, which ensures that the data in the tables is consistent.
Referential integrity: Referential integrity is a property of a database that ensures that the data in the tables is consistent. Referential integrity is enforced by foreign keys, which are columns in a table that reference the primary keys of other tables.
Demos:

Demo 1: This demo shows how to create a many-to-many relationship between two tables in MySQL.
Demo 2: This demo shows how to query a many-to-many relationship in MySQL.
Demo 3: This demo shows how to update a many-to-many relationship in MySQL.
Demo 4: This demo shows how to delete a many-to-many relationship in MySQL.

Sure, here are some scripts for demos that might be helpful:

Demo 1: Creating a Many-to-Many Relationship in MySQL

SQL
-- Create the tables
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

CREATE TABLE classes (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Create the join table
CREATE TABLE students_classes (
  student_id INT NOT NULL,
  class_id INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (student_id, class_id),
  FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students (id),
  FOREIGN KEY (class_id) REFERENCES classes (id)
);
Use code with caution. Learn more
Demo 2: Querying a Many-to-Many Relationship in MySQL

SQL
-- Get all students who are taking the class "Introduction to SQL"
SELECT s.name
FROM students s
JOIN students_classes sc ON s.id = sc.student_id
JOIN classes c ON sc.class_id = c.id
WHERE c.name = 'Introduction to SQL';
Use code with caution. Learn more
Demo 3: Updating a Many-to-Many Relationship in MySQL

SQL
-- Change the class that the student "John Doe" is taking
UPDATE students_classes
SET class_id = 2
WHERE student_id = 1;
Use code with caution. Learn more
Demo 4: Deleting a Many-to-Many Relationship in MySQL

SQL
-- Delete the relationship between the student "John Doe" and the class "Introduction to SQL"
DELETE FROM students_classes
WHERE student_id = 1 AND class_id = 1;
Use code with caution. Learn more
