Title: Working with One to Many Relationships
Section: SQL
Subsection: SQL-Relationships

Key terms, concepts, and any other relevant information and definitions:

One-to-many relationship: A one-to-many relationship is a type of database relationship in which one row in one table can be related to many rows in another table. For example, a table of students could have a one-to-many relationship with a table of classes, where each student could be enrolled in many classes.
Foreign key: A foreign key is a column in a table that references the primary key of another table. Foreign keys are used to enforce referential integrity, which ensures that the data in the database is consistent.
Referential integrity: Referential integrity is a set of rules that ensures that the data in a database is consistent. One of the rules of referential integrity is that the foreign key column must contain a value that exists in the primary key column of the referenced table.

Sure, here are some scripts for demos that might be helpful:

Demo 1: Creating a One-to-Many Relationship

SQL
-- Create the students table
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Create the classes table
CREATE TABLE classes (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Create a one-to-many relationship between the students and classes tables
ALTER TABLE students
ADD FOREIGN KEY (class_id)
REFERENCES classes (id);
Use code with caution. Learn more
Demo 2: Inserting Data into a One-to-Many Relationship

SQL
-- Insert data into the students table
INSERT INTO students (name) VALUES ('John Doe');
INSERT INTO students (name) VALUES ('Jane Doe');

-- Insert data into the classes table
INSERT INTO classes (name) VALUES ('Introduction to SQL');
INSERT INTO classes (name) VALUES ('Advanced SQL');

-- Associate John Doe with Introduction to SQL
UPDATE students
SET class_id = 1
WHERE name = 'John Doe';

-- Associate Jane Doe with Advanced SQL
UPDATE students
SET class_id = 2
WHERE name = 'Jane Doe';
Use code with caution. Learn more
Demo 3: Updating Data in a One-to-Many Relationship

SQL
-- Update John Doe's class to Advanced SQL
UPDATE students
SET class_id = 2
WHERE name = 'John Doe';

-- Check the results
SELECT *
FROM students;
Use code with caution. Learn more
Demo 4: Deleting Data in a One-to-Many Relationship

SQL
-- Delete Jane Doe from the students table
DELETE FROM students
WHERE name = 'Jane Doe';

-- Check the results
SELECT *
FROM students;
Use code with caution. Learn more
I hope these demos are helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.
