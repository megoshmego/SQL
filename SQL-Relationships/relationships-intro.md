Subsection: SQL-Relationships

Key terms, concepts, and any other relevant information and definitions:

Relational database: A relational database is a database that organizes data into tables. Each table has a set of columns and rows. The columns define the data types of the data in each row, and the rows contain the actual data.
Relationship: A relationship is a connection between two tables. There are three types of relationships: one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many.
One-to-one relationship: A one-to-one relationship is a relationship between two tables where each row in one table can be related to only one row in the other table. For example, a table of students could have a one-to-one relationship with a table of addresses, where each student has only one address.
One-to-many relationship: A one-to-many relationship is a relationship between two tables where each row in one table can be related to many rows in the other table. For example, a table of students could have a one-to-many relationship with a table of classes, where each student can be enrolled in many classes.
Many-to-many relationship: A many-to-many relationship is a relationship between two tables where each row in one table can be related to many rows in the other table, and vice versa. For example, a table of students could have a many-to-many relationship with a table of classes, where each student can be enrolled in many classes, and each class can have many students enrolled in it.

Sure, here are some scripts for demos that might be helpful:

Demo 1: Creating a One-to-One Relationship

SQL
-- Create the students table
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Create the addresses table
CREATE TABLE addresses (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  street VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  city VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  state VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  zipcode VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Create a one-to-one relationship between the students and addresses tables
ALTER TABLE students
ADD FOREIGN KEY (address_id)
REFERENCES addresses (id);
Use code with caution. Learn more
Demo 2: Creating a One-to-Many Relationship

SQL
-- Create the students table
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Create the classes table
CREATE TABLE classes (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Create a one-to-many relationship between the students and classes tables
ALTER TABLE students
ADD FOREIGN KEY (class_id)
REFERENCES classes (id);
Use code with caution. Learn more
Demo 3: Creating a Many-to-Many Relationship

SQL
-- Create the students table
CREATE TABLE students (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Create the classes table
CREATE TABLE classes (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

-- Create a many-to-many relationship between the students and classes tables
CREATE TABLE students_classes (
  student_id INT NOT NULL,
  class_id INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (student_id, class_id)
);
Use code with caution. Learn more
