Title: Basic PSQL Commands
Course: SQL
Section: Databases Intro

Key Concepts and Definitions:

Postgres: A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
psql: Command-line interface for interacting with a PostgreSQL server.
Database: A collection of related data, organized in tables, rows, and columns.
create_db: Command to create a new database in PostgreSQL.
Seeding a database: Filling a database with initial data for testing or development purposes.
.sql file: A file containing SQL commands, often used for seeding or executing multiple SQL statements.
SQL (Structured Query Language): A standard programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases.
Relevant Information:

The script starts by showing how to connect to a PostgreSQL server using psql.
Multiple databases can be created and managed using PostgreSQL.
Each database can have its own tables and data.
You can connect to a specific database by running psql [database_name].
To create a new database, run create_db [database_name].
Seeding a database involves initializing it with some data, which can be done using an .sql file.
To execute an .sql file, run psql < [file_name].sql.
Within the psql shell, you can use backslash commands (e.g., \l, \dt, \d) to list databases, tables, and get information about specific tables.
In this video, the instructor uses the following demos:

Connecting to a PostgreSQL server using psql.
Connecting to a specific database.
Creating a new database with create_db.
Seeding a database using an .sql file.
Using backslash commands in the psql shell to list databases, tables, and get information about specific tables.
The script is relevant and covers important basic concepts and commands related to PostgreSQL databases, which will be helpful for someone just starting to learn about databases and SQL.



Based on the video transcript you provided, I can suggest two demos that will help you get started with basic PSQL commands.

Demo 1: Creating a new database and listing databases

makefile
Copy code
# Create a new database
$ createdb test_db

# Connect to the new database
$ psql test_db

# List all databases (inside the Postgres shell)
test_db=# \l

# Quit the Postgres shell
test_db=# \q
Demo 2: Creating a table and inserting data

sql
Copy code
# Create a .sql file containing the table schema and sample data
$ nano create_movies_table.sql

# Add the following SQL code to the file
CREATE TABLE movies (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    release_year INTEGER,
    runtime INTEGER,
    rating FLOAT
);

INSERT INTO movies (title, release_year, runtime, rating) VALUES
    ('Inception', 2010, 148, 8.8),
    ('The Dark Knight', 2008, 152, 9.0),
    ('Interstellar', 2014, 169, 8.6),
    ('The Prestige', 2006, 130, 8.5),
    ('Memento', 2000, 113, 8.4);

# Save the file and exit the text editor

# Execute the .sql file
$ psql test_db < create_movies_table.sql

# Connect to the test_db database
$ psql test_db

# List all tables (inside the Postgres shell)
test_db=# \dt

# Select all data from the movies table
test_db=# SELECT * FROM movies;

# Quit the Postgres shell
test_db=# \q
These demos should help you understand how to create a new database, connect to a database, list databases, create a table, insert data, and query the data in the table using basic PSQL commands.
