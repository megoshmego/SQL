Title: "Postgres Intro"
Course: SQL
Subsection: Databases Intro

Key terms and concepts:

PostgreSQL (Postgres): A popular, powerful, open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that uses SQL for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data. It closely follows the SQL standard and provides good compatibility with other relational databases.

SQL (Structured Query Language): A standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. SQL enables users to perform tasks such as creating tables, inserting data, updating records, and querying data.

RDBMS (Relational Database Management System): A type of database management system that stores data in a structured format using tables with rows and columns. RDBMSs provide an efficient way to manage and retrieve large amounts of data by using SQL queries.

MySQL: Another popular open-source RDBMS that closely follows the SQL standard, making it a good choice for many applications. However, MySQL has experienced some drama with maintenance since being acquired by Oracle.

SQLite: A lightweight, self-contained RDBMS that stores data in a single file, often used for mobile and desktop applications. SQLite is also compatible with SQL.

Standard SQL: A standardized version of the SQL language that specifies syntax and features. Some databases implement additional, non-standard features that may not be compatible with other databases.

For demos, please refer to the previous response I provided, which includes two demos for basic PSQL commands. These demos will help you create a new database, connect to a database, list databases, create a table, insert data, and query the data in the table using basic PSQL commands.
